    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>A simple and versatile slow cooker vegetable soup that's perfect for an easy lunch or supper. Any leftovers will
        keep very well in the fridge for a couple of days, or can be frozen.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 celery stick, cut into roughly 1cm/½in slices</li>
        <li>2-3 carrots (around 250g/9oz), peeled and cut into roughly 1cm/½in chunks</li>
        <li>½ small swede (around 275g/9¾oz), peeled and cut into roughly 1cm/½in chunks</li>
        <li>3 potatoes (around 375g/13oz), peeled and cut into roughly 15mm/¾in chunks</li>
        <li>1 tsp mixed dried herbs</li>
        <li>600ml/20fl oz hot vegetable stock, made with 2 vegetable stock cubes</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ground turmeric (optional)</li>
        <li>100ml/3½fl oz milk or water</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>chopped fresh flatleaf parsley, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan and fry the onion, celery and carrots for 4-5 minutes, stirring
            regularly until beginning to soften. Tip into a slow cooker and add the swede, potatoes, mixed herbs, stock
            and turmeric, if using. Season with lots of pepper and stir well.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook on High for 3½-4 hours or Low for 5-7 hours, until the vegetables are just tender.</li>
        <li>Take 3 ladlefuls of the cooked soup (around 450g/1lb) and transfer to a large bowl or jug. Using a stick
            blender, blitz to a purée then return to the slow cooker pot and mix thoroughly to thicken the soup.</li>
        <li>Stir in enough milk or water to reach the preferred consistency then cover and cook on High for a further
            10-15 minutes, or until hot. Season with salt and pepper and scatter over the parsely, if using. Serve with
            warm crusty bread, if you like.</li>
    </ol>
