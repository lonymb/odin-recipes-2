            </div>

            <div class="list">
                <ol>
                    <li>Brush the inside of a 20cm/8in springform tin with the sunflower oil, and line the base with a disc of
                        baking parchment.</li>
                    <li>Put the digestive biscuits into a sealable freezer bag. Push all the air out and seal the bag. Crush the
                        biscuits with a rolling pin, until they are reduced to sand-like crumbs.</li>
                    <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Stir in the biscuit crumbs and cinnamon. Press the crumbs into the
                        bottom of the tin. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Chop 150g/5oz of the strawberries in half from top to bottom and arrange around the edge of the prepared
                        tin, cut side-up. Chop the remaining berries into small pieces.</li>
                    <li>Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, either over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn't
                        touch the water, or in a microwave.</li>
                    <li>Beat together the cream cheese, vanilla, lemon zest and honey in a mixing bowl. Stir in the chopped
                        strawberries.</li>
                    <li>In another bowl, whisk the double cream until it holds a floppy peak.</li>
                    <li>Fold the melted chocolate into the cream cheese mixture, followed by the double cream. Add more honey if
                        needed.</li>
                    <li>Spoon the filling into the tin, being careful not to move the strawberries on the edge. Spread level with a
                        palette knife or the back of a spoon, cover with cling film and chill overnight, until firm.</li>
                    <li>Carefully remove the cheesecake from the tin and put on a serving plate. Slice or quarter extra strawberries
                        to arrange on top.</li>
                </ol>
