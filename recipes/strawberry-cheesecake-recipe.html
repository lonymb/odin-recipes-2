    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>200g/7oz digestive biscuits</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>100g/3½oz white chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>400g/14oz strawberries, trimmed, plus extra to decorate</li>
        <li>300g/10½oz full-fat cream cheese</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ unwaxed lemon, finely grated zest only</li>
        <li>1 tbsp runny honey or maple syrup</li>
        <li>200ml/7fl oz double cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brush the inside of a 20cm/8in springform tin with the sunflower oil, and line the base with a disc of
            baking parchment.</li>
        <li>Put the digestive biscuits into a sealable freezer bag. Push all the air out and seal the bag. Crush the
            biscuits with a rolling pin, until they are reduced to sand-like crumbs.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan. Stir in the biscuit crumbs and cinnamon. Press the crumbs into the
            bottom of the tin. Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Chop 150g/5oz of the strawberries in half from top to bottom and arrange around the edge of the prepared
            tin, cut side-up. Chop the remaining berries into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl, either over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl doesn't
            touch the water, or in a microwave.</li>
        <li>Beat together the cream cheese, vanilla, lemon zest and honey in a mixing bowl. Stir in the chopped
            strawberries.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, whisk the double cream until it holds a floppy peak.</li>
        <li>Fold the melted chocolate into the cream cheese mixture, followed by the double cream. Add more honey if
            needed.</li>
        <li>Spoon the filling into the tin, being careful not to move the strawberries on the edge. Spread level with a
            palette knife or the back of a spoon, cover with cling film and chill overnight, until firm.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the cheesecake from the tin and put on a serving plate. Slice or quarter extra strawberries
            to arrange on top.</li>
    </ol>
